# 0.25.0 Migration Guide

## Deprecations

- In previous versions of Dokku, the only way to specify a custom `Dockerfile` was to use the `docker-options` plugin to set the `--file` flag for a docker build. As of 0.25.0, the `builder-dockerfile:set` command should be used instead, as outlined in the [docs here](/docs/deployment/builders/dockerfiles.md#changingthe-dockerfile-location). Usage of the old method should be migrated to the new method.
